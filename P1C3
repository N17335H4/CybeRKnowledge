The following list includes devices, system and applications on which you might perform vulnerability and penetration tests:
•	Routers and switches
•	Firewalls
•	Wireless access points
•	Web applications (internal, external – hosted locally or inand the cloud)
•	Database, email and file servers
•	Mobile devices (such as smartphones and tablets) that store confidential information
•	Physical security cameras and building access control systems
•	Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and industrial control systems
•	Workstations and servers

Consider the factors:
•	Whether the computer or application resides on the network or in the cloud.
•	Which OS and applications the system runs.
•	The amount or type of critical information stored on the system.

Bow Tie and FMEA
Attack tree analysis is the process of creating a flow-chart type mapping of how malicious attackers would attack a system. Attack trees are used in higher-level information risk analyses; they are also used by security-savvy development teams for planning new software projects.

Cloud: a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet and used to store, manage, and process data in place of local servers or personal computers.
IP address: a unique string of numbers separated by full stops that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network. An IP address serves two principal functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing.
Use checksums where possible by comparing the original MD5 or SHA checksum with the one you get using a tool such as CheckSum Tool (http://sourceforge.net/projects/checksumtool).
