Devices such as routers, firewalls, and even generic network hosts (including servers and workstations) must be assessed as part of the security testing process.
The better you understand network protocols, the easier network vulnerability testing is because network protocols are the foundation for most information security concepts.

o-> 1:
Where devices, such as a firewall or an intrusion prevention system (IPS), are placed on the network and how they’re configured.
What external attackers see when they perform port scans and how they can exploit vulnerabilities in your network hosts.
Network design, such as Internet connections, remote access capabilities, layered defenses, and placement of hosts on the network.
Interaction of installed security devices, such as firewalls, IPSes, and antivirus.
What protocols are in use, including known-vulnerable ones such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
Commonly attacked ports that are unprotected.
Network host configurations.
Network monitoring and maintenance.
Test systems from the outside in and the inside in (that is, on and between internal network segments and demilitarized zones [DMZs]).
Obtain permission from partner networks to check for vulnerabilities on their systems that can affect our network’s security, such as open ports, lack of a firewall, or a misconfigured router.
Tools: port scanners, protocol analyzers and vulnerability assessment tools.
